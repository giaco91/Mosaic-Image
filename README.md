# Mosaik Image
A code that fits the pixels of a given image to small images of a given image collection. You find an example image at `mosaik_images/test.jpeg`.

##How to generate your own image
Use `mosaik_main.py` and hand over parser arguments. By default it uses the macro image at `makro_images/main5.jpg` and the micro images
from the folder `preprocessed_size=45` and generates the mosaik image that you find at `mosaik_images/test.jpeg`.

You have a lot of freedom to design your very own mosaik image! In the following I explain the paramerters you can set in `mosaik_main.py` in more detail.
